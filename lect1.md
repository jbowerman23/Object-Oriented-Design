# Intro

## Types of Programming

### Structured:
- break apart into functions/subroutines.modules

### Object Oriented Programming:
- combining data and code into self contained groupings

### Functional:
- use of math like functions to organize code into reuseable blocks

---

## Uses
- Games
- GUIs
- Web Services

All are long-lived state frequently accessed

---

## Classes
- Constructor
- Method
- fields/properties/memer variable
- instances 
  - a specific one of a blueprint
- access restrictions

---

## Encapsulation
  
  ```c++
  #include <iostream> // Allows us to read to or write from the console
  #include <istream>
  
  string readContnents(string filename);
  ifstream input(filename);
   
  int fileId;
  int readPos;
   
  int i;
  input >> i; 
  
  cin >> i;
  ```
 
Have classes to group and create simplier interfacee

- Show interface
- Hide implementation

##ifstream:
- subclass of istream
- cin is a different istream sub class
